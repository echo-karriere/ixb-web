# About Us

_Information about ITxBERGEN for international companies and foreign students_

## 1. About ITxBERGEN

ITxBERGEN is a non-profit organization that aims to promote oppertunities for students in the IT industry.
We collaborate with other IT and technology student associations in Bergen, reaching out to students at the University of Bergen,
Western Norway University of Applied Sciences, Kristiania University College and for anyone interested.

<br />
We started in 2019 under the name "echo karriere", and originated from the line association
echo at the University of Bergen. Today, we reach out to most of the line associations
for IT in Bergen, and reach out to almost all IT students in Norway's second largest
city.

## 2. Career Fairs

We hold the Career Fair annually, and the dates when it is held are published on the front page of our website

## 3. How to Attend the Career Fair

If you are an exchange student in Bergen, then you are very welcome to attend the career fair.
Information on where and when it will be held will be published on the front page. There is no cost for students to participate.

## 4. What to Expect at The Career Fair

At the careers fair, it is possible to walk around and talk to companies at different stands. At the same time, it is possible to attend various concept presentations and workshops, but these will most likely be held in Norwegian. For those students who are extra lucky, they may be invited to the banquet held at the end of the career fair. More information about the banquet will be provided to those invited.
